## Data

Data is in xlsx format and synced with upstream source yearly. It is sourced from https://stat.gov.kz/.

  * Average annual water consumption in m3/s
  * Rivers length in km
  * River fall in m
  * Water and energy resources power in thousand kW
  * Water and energy resources energy in million kWh/year
